In lieu of a proper license: I have to do some digging to find out what kind of license I am allowed
to use with the material that is currently in this repo. All the stuff I created can be used with a
Create Commons Attribution 4.0 License.
However, not all the code here is done by me and unfortunately, not forked from another GitHub repo
but is material that is part of a textbook but freely available from the publisher's website.
Once I have found out what kind of license is used there, I can create an official license for this repo.
Until then, please be so kind and do look up what you are allowed to do and not to do with this file [dzcnapy](InnsbruckEasterplay/dzcnapy_plotlib.py)
on the publisher's website yourself: [Source Code to CNA in Python](https://pragprog.com/titles/dzcnapy/source_code)
